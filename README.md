In this case i create a dictionary table to break 2 encoding password list. Both can be solved in less than one hour calculation. Formspring one is cracked throughout SHA256 method and also saltted , hile linkedin one is cracked with SHA1 way. I upload these two files to suggest that infamous rockyou.txt is worhty to be used in the cracking process and the password need to be avoided in rockyou.txt . The process to solve Formsping one is tricky since it is salted with one char, so plz be careful to encoding the user password and make sure you salt it when storing.
